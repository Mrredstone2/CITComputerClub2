   <div class="blurb"><p>Hello. My name is Sid Kumar, and I am the president of Computer Club for the 2021-22 school year. Computer Club is a place where people who are interested in computer related topics can gather and learn more about those topics amongst like-minded people. The club is split into groups that each have a focus on a different area of computer science, where each week the group lead has a lesson on a topic in that interest area.

    <div class="blurb"><p>Our goal for the video game design section of computer club is to work together and create a game while exploring the various aspects of game development. To achieve this, we have divided our section into 3 groups: the game designers, script writers, and asset creators. Through the different groups available, students will have the opportunity to explore all aspects of game development and choose one that they like the most.<br>-Ashish & Raahul</p>

    <div class="blurb"><p>Hello. My name is Alex Demchenko and I am the leader of AI Club at Deep Run. We meet every Friday at 4:00 PM in SC4, which is Mrs. Norris’ room. In AI Club, we learn about machine learning and its applications in the real world. We also discuss recent developments in AI and learn about their consequences. Later in the year, we will also have a project where we create a functioning machine learning demo. If you don’t know how to create one, that’s okay. We will conduct lessons about demos throughout the year. I hope to see you there.

   <div class="blurb"><p>Welcome to Computer Club. My name is Carson Krahe and I am the group leader for cybersecurity. So, what do we do here? We do CyberPatriot, which is a nationwide competition where we find vulnerabilities in virtual computer systems. Now that sounds like a lot, but it is basically a scavenger hunt to find ways to make your system more secure. So, some questions you may have: Do I need any experience? No, you don’t need any experience and I will help you up to the first competition and you will have teammates to help you. What will you be learning about? Hopefully, we will learn how to write scripts, the basic vulnerabilities that systems have, how to handle a CyberPatriot competition, and things like that. So come out to cybersecurity and we will be glad to have you. I hope to see you there.

    <div class="blurb"><p>Hello. I am Lakshay, a junior at the CIT and I will be the lead for Intermediate Programming at the Computer Club this year. In Intermediate Programming we will mainly focus on the programming language of Java. I have known how to code in Java for three years now and have a good understanding of how to utilize it. If you know a bit of Java and already want to take it to the next level, then this is the perfect group for you. We will cover everything from variables to classes to libraries, and at the end there will be a fun project like building your own chess AI, drawing using AWT, or making a simple game. The possibilities are endless.

    <div class="photo"><img style="width: 100%" src="https://github.com/Mrredstone2/CITComputerClub2/blob/main/Chris%20New.PNG?raw=true" alt="Image of Web Design"></div>
    <div class="blurb"><p>Hi, my name is Christopher, and I’m going to be leading the Web Development club at Computer Club this year. With help from WIlliam Gray, it’s going to be super fun and exciting. WE’re going to start out learning the basics of web development, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then we are going to move on to more intermediate and advanced topics like using ExpressJS as our backend and PassportJS for user authentication and MongoDB for our database and anything else that we have time to learn. We are going to be learning, and then at the end of the year, we are going to work together to create some kind of large end-of-the-year project all together and it is overall just going to be a lot of fun. So, if you have never written a single line of code before or you are an intermediate or even advanced programmer or anywhere in between, I highly recommend, if you are interested in web development, to come check out the Web Development group. So, see you at Computer Club.

    <div class="blurb"><p>Hi everyone, I’m Sharada and I run Graphic Design at Computer Club. We design graphics, we use photoshop, but we also just use Microsoft Paint sometimes. So, some of the things that we do is redesign logos for existing companies. So last year, I did Spotify, and I kind of redid it a little bit but I kept the general basis so you could still recognize it as Spotify, but we also do things like make up our own companies, give them a mission, and create a logo for that as well, as well as creating movie posters or redoing preexisting movie posters. But this year, we’re going to be up a little more into video design and graphics for videos, so it should be a really good time and if you’re creative and interested in technology then you should definitely come down and check it out.

    <div class="blurb"><p>Hi everyone, my name is Sam and I’m going to be a senior in the CIT. I’m going to be the new lead for the Intro to Programming group in the Computer Club this year and if you don’t have any programming experience then this is probably going to be the best fit for you because we’re going to be going over the basics like loops and arrays and use that knowledge to create some cool projects and games such as calculator apps and more complex stuff like Battleship. We’re going to start with the language Python, which is pretty popular and it’s known for its readability which is great for if you’re just getting to code. So that’s pretty much it, thanks for watching.
